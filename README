# Inventory Management System API

This is a Django-based Inventory Management System API that allows users to manage their inventory through secure, JWT-authenticated endpoints. The API supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on inventory items, with Redis caching implemented for frequently accessed items to improve performance.

## Features

- **Inventory CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete items in the inventory.
- **Redis Caching**: Frequently accessed items are cached in Redis to optimize performance.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to endpoints using JWT tokens.
- **Django ORM**: Interact with the database through Django's ORM.
- **Logging**: API usage and errors are logged.
- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are implemented to ensure API functionality.
